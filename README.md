# Application Concept

* Develop an application supporting an exploration of Hillforts
* Users are archaeology students.
* App should contain a list of hillforts they have been assigned to visit.
* Users visit site, take photos + notes which augment the information on the hillfort provided by the app.
Students can add additional Hillforts - which may be uncharted
